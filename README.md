# NeoFPS_BehaviorDesigner
NeoFPS and Behavior Designer integration assets

## Requirements
This repository was created using Unity 2018.4

It requires the assets [NeoFPS](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/neofps-150179?aid=1011l58Ft) 
and [Behavior Designer](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/behavior-designer-behavior-trees-for-everyone-15277?aid=1011l58Ft).

## Installation

:::WARNING:::
At the current time this integration assumes that you have the [OPTIONAL] items below
installed. This should not create errors, but may create warnings. Features not requiring
optional components should still work. If you find this is not the case please raise an 
issue on GitHub.

This integration example is intended to be dropped in to a fresh project along with NeoFPS and Behavior Designer.

1. Import NeoFPS and apply the required Unity settings using the NeoFPS Settings Wizard. You can find more information about this process [here](https://docs.neofps.com/manual/neofps-installation.html).

2. Import the Behavior Designer asset.

3. Clone this repository to a folder inside the project Assets folder such as "NeoFPS_BehaviorDesigner"

4. [Optional] If you want to play the demo scene you need to import [Basic Motions Free Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-free-pack-154271?aid=1101l866w) 

5. [Optional] If you want to see how the integrations work with fully animated soldiers import the (not free, but cheap) [Toon Soldiers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/toon-soldiers-52220?aid=1101l866w)
	
## Integration

This integration provides a number of Behavior Designer tasks that make it easier to integrate Neo FPS into your project. 
These can be located in the "Actions/Neo FPS" and "Conditional/Neo FPS" categories.

We've tried to make this as self-documenting as possible using the tooltips and documentation strings used 
in Behavior Designer itself. If you have questions ask them on the [Neo FPS Discord](https://discord.neofps.com/).

## Animation

Included in the Scripts folder is a class to translate Nav Mesh Agent movements to animation inputs, see 
`SimpleLocomotionAgent`. This monobehaviour can be dropped on your NPCs and it will convert movement into 
inputs for your Animator. By default the inputs are:

  * `Move` a boolean indicating if the agent is moving under its own power
  * 'XVelocity` a relative velocity between 0 and 1 on the x axis
  * 'YVelocity` a relative velocity between 0 and 1 on the y axis

The names of these parameters can be changed in the inspector.

By setting up your animation controller to use these inputs you can have your character animate appropriately
based on the movements defined in your behaviour tree. The sample scene contains a character that is
wired up to use this method. However, you will need the 
[Basic Motions Free Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-free-pack-154271?aid=1101l866w) 
for the animations to work. Install this pack.

You can, of course, trigger animations from directly within your Behaviour Trees, or you can integrate your
favorite controller. 

## Demo Scenes

We've included a simple demo scene, see `NeoFPS_Melee_Ragdoll_Demo`. This requires the [Basic Motions Free Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-free-pack-154271?aid=1101l866w).
The goal of this is to show how to setup a character.
This scene shows simple movement using a NavMesh. The character will rush to the player and attack them (no animation for attack).
If you shoot the player they will die and then respawn a few seconds later.

There is also some demo scenes within the `Toon Soldier Scenes` folder. These require the (not free, but cheap) [Toon Soldiers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/toon-soldiers-52220?aid=1101l866w).
Since these scenes have a number of enemies and animations they can show off more of what is possible with Behaviour Designer.

## Setting Up A new NPC Character with your own Animations

The following is a descripton of the basic steps for setting up your own model and animations to use the Behaviour Designer integrations.

  1. Import your character into the scene
  2. Ensure that it has a collider 
  3. Add and configure the `AIController` script
  4. Add the `SimpleLocomotionAgent` script
  5. Create an `Animator Override Controller` from `NeoFPS_BehaviourDesigner/Animations/Shooter Controller with APose Placeholders`
  6. Apply overrides for all aniation states in this controller. If you do not provide an override you will have an A Pose in that slot.
  6. Ensure the NavMeshAgent is setup correctly (if the model didn't have one the simple locomotion agent script will add one)
  7. Add and configure Neo FPS `BasicHealthManager`
  8. Add and configure Neo FPS `BasicDamageHandler`
  9. Add and configure Neo FPS `SimpleSurface`
  10. Add a Behaviour Tree component and drag `NeoFPS_BehaviourDesigner/Behaviour Trees/Seek and Destroy` into the `External Behaviour` parameter
  11. Hit play, your character should now be animated and will seek out the player and fire when within range
